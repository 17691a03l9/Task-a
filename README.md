There two main tags in html one is head and another one is body
In head I gave title in that I gave title name which is displayed on the top navbar when we open that in default browser.
And linkup font styles and css file with thw use of link tag.
Coming to body there are three sections sec-1,sec-2,footer.
In sec-1 I use class attribute it is to apply multiple styles for the items whatever we give inside of that.
